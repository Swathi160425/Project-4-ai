# Project-4-ai
 Consider using libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch for implementing machine
learning algorithms.
- Experiment with different preprocessing techniques and features to improve model
performance.
- Keep an eye on class imbalances in your dataset, as spam messages are often much less
frequent than non-spam.
Remember, the effectiveness of your spam classifier depends on the quality of your data, the
chosen algorithm, and the fine-tuning process. Good luck with your project! If you have specific
questions or encounter challenges along the way, feel free to ask for help.

Explanation:
Import Libraries:
Import the necessary libraries, including scikit-learn for machine learning operations.
Load Dataset:
Load your labeled dataset. Make sure it has columns for text messages ('text') and
spam/ham labels ('label').
Split Data:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
Vectorize Text Data:
Use the CountVectorizer to convert text data into numerical features (bag-of-words
model).
Train Naive Bayes Classifier:
Initialize and train a Naive Bayes classifier using the MultinomialNB class.
Make Predictions:
Use the trained classifier to make predictions on the test set.
Evaluate Performance:
Calculate accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report to assess the model's
performance.
Print Results:
Display the results, including accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Remember to replace 'your_dataset.csv' with the actual path or name of your dataset file. Also,
feel free to experiment with other algorithms, features, or hyperparameter tuning to improve
performance.Evaluate the performance of the classifier
